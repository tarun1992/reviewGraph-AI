# Security model

ReviewGraph keeps **all secrets on the server**. The React UI only talks to `http://127.0.0.1:4000` (or your deployed API); it never receives Neo4j passwords, Aura API keys, or GitHub/GitLab tokens.

---

## What stays server-side

| Secret | Location | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD` | `.env` | Bolt driver in `server/neo4j.js` |
| `AURA_CLIENT_ID`, `AURA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AURA_AGENT_INVOKE_URL` | `.env` | OAuth + invoke in `server/auraAgent.js` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN` | `.env` | Ingest only (`domains/codereview/sources/`) |

Do not commit `.env`. Do not add `VITE_*` variables for these values — Vite would embed them in the client bundle.

---

## API responses (sanitized)

`server/clientSafe.js` strips before JSON reaches the browser:

- Aura **invoke URLs** (org/agent paths)
- **`rawContent`** from Aura responses
- **OAuth / HTTP error bodies** (generic messages only)
- Token-like patterns (`ghp_`, `glpat-`, `Bearer …`, Bolt URIs, etc.)
- Detailed **`sourceError`** from ingest (UI gets `sourceWarning` only)

`/api/health` and `/api/meta` expose only:

```json
"auraAgent": { "enabled": true, "mode": "primary", "ready": true }
```

---

## Endpoints and risk

| Endpoint | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/ask` | Runs templated or Aura-mediated graph queries | No user-supplied Cypher; Aura credentials server-only |
| `POST /api/cypher` | **Arbitrary Cypher** if enabled | **Disabled by default**; set `ENABLE_DEV_CYPHER=true` only for local debugging |
| `GET /api/*` | Read model / memory | No secrets in payloads |

---

## Network defaults

- **`HOST=127.0.0.1`** — API not exposed on all interfaces by default.
- **CORS** — Allowed origins from `CORS_ORIGIN` (default Vite dev URLs). Other browser origins are rejected.
- **Body limit** — `64kb` on JSON routes.

For production, put the API behind HTTPS and authentication; this repo is oriented to local/demo use.

---

## Checklist before sharing or deploying

1. `.env` is in `.gitignore` and not in the client build.
2. `ENABLE_DEV_CYPHER` is unset or `false` in shared environments.
3. `HOST` and firewall rules match your exposure needs.
4. Aura API keys are rotated if they were ever logged or committed.
