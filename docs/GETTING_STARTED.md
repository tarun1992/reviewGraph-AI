# Getting Started — ReviewGraph AI

The complete, step-by-step guide: run the demo, explore the flagship pull request, ask the graph, connect Neo4j Aura, and generate the presentation decks.

ReviewGraph AI is an **Aura-powered engineering intelligence agent** for reviewing AI-written code. It reasons over three layers — a **Code Intelligence Graph**, an **Aura Agent**, and **Agent Memory** — and never gives a verdict without cited graph evidence.

**Generic by design:** point at **any GitHub or GitLab repository** and **any Neo4j database** using only `.env` — no application code changes.

## 0. Concept in one picture

```text
 source/diff ──▶ ingest (seed / CSV) ──▶ Neo4j code graph ──▶ Aura agent + REST API ──▶ React UI
                                                  │
                          Text2Cypher · reviewer recommendation · risk propagation
                          architectural compliance · incident-aware review · agent memory
```

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm**.
- *(Optional)* A **Neo4j Aura** (free tier) or **Neo4j Desktop** instance. Not required for the demo — it runs on an in-memory graph.

---

## 2. Install and run

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # optional: point at your repo + Neo4j
npm run dev
```

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
- UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (use this URL — Vite proxies `/api` to the server)

The header shows the active **data source** (`demo`, `github`, or `gitlab`) and connected repository when configured. Click **Refresh** in the PR list to re-ingest after changing `.env` or opening new PRs on GitHub/GitLab.

Explore the three tabs:

- **Assessment** — explainable risk score with weighted, graph-cited evidence, plus impact chips for affected services, **recommended reviewers**, and **downstream services** (risk propagation).
- **Ask the Graph** — natural-language questions routed to Cypher (Text2Cypher), with the generated query shown.
- **Agent Memory** — decisions, lessons, and incidents, plus the assessments you commit.

---

## 3. Review any repository (GitHub or GitLab)

ReviewGraph AI is **generic across VCS hosts**: the same product reviews any repo you point it at. Configure `.env` only — no fork or code change required.

### Choose a data source

| `SOURCE` | When to use | What to set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo` | Try the product offline | *(nothing — default)* |
| `github` | GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise | `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `gitlab` | GitLab.com or **self-managed GitLab in your org** | `GITLAB_PROJECT`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_API` |

If `SOURCE` is omitted, GitLab is chosen when `GITLAB_PROJECT` is set; otherwise GitHub when `GITHUB_REPO` is set; otherwise demo.

### GitHub

```env
GITHUB_REPO=owner/repository
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxx          # required for private repos
GITHUB_PR=512                      # optional: ingest one PR only
GITHUB_MAX_PRS=15
# GITHUB_API=https://github.example.com/api/v3   # Enterprise
```

### GitLab (organizations / self-hosted)

```env
GITLAB_PROJECT=group/subgroup/project   # or numeric project id
GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-xxxxxxxx             # recommended; required for private projects
GITLAB_MR=42                            # optional: one merge request (IID)
GITLAB_MAX_MRS=15
GITLAB_API=https://gitlab.com/api/v4    # your instance: https://gitlab.company.com/api/v4
```

On startup the server:

1. Fetches open/recent merge requests (or pull requests) and their diffs.
2. Builds **File → Module → Service** structure from paths and import edges in the diff.
3. Loads **CODEOWNERS** (or `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS`) for reviewer recommendation.
4. Loads **`docs/reviewgraph-config.json`** (or `.reviewgraph.json` / `.github/reviewgraph.json`) — full file from the PR **head branch**, not truncated diff patches ([example](reviewgraph-config.example.json)).

Then run `npm run seed` to write the graph into Neo4j (any Bolt-compatible database).

### Neo4j (any instance)

```env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io   # Aura
# NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687             # Desktop / Docker
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
```

---

## 4. Explore the flagship scenario (demo mode)

Open **`PR-512`**. It reintroduces a `BillingService → AuthService` coupling that was previously reverted in `PR-312` and traced to `Incident-47`. ReviewGraph AI:

- flags it as **high risk** and cites every node behind the verdict,
- recommends the right **reviewers** (service owners + prior reviewers + security),
- shows the **downstream services** that could break, and
- reports that it **violates ADR-7**.

Try these questions in **Ask the Graph**:

| Question | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| *Why is this PR risky?* | evidence-cited risk explanation |
| *Who should review this PR?* | reviewer recommendation |
| *What could break if this merges?* | risk propagation |
| *Does this violate our architecture?* | architectural compliance |
| *Has a similar change caused problems before?* | incident-aware review |

---

## 5. The graph model

| Layer | Nodes | Tells you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L1 — Code Intelligence** | `Repository`, `PullRequest`, `File`, `Module`, `Service`, `Dependency`, `ReviewComment`, `IssueType`, `RiskPattern`, `Developer`, `Team` | what the AI changed and how the system is connected |
| **L2 — Operations & org** | `Incident`, `Deployment`, `Release`, `ADR`, `SecurityFinding` | impact, ownership, history, policy |
| **L3 — Agent Memory** | `Decision`, `Lesson`, `RiskAssessment`, `Evidence` | what we learned and decided |

The graph and feature selectors live in [`domains/codereview/model.js`](../domains/codereview/model.js); the explainable engine in [`domains/codereview/assess.js`](../domains/codereview/assess.js); Text2Cypher routing in [`domains/codereview/questions.js`](../domains/codereview/questions.js).

> Golden rule: **no verdict without evidence.** Every assessment's score is the sum of weighted evidence items, each with a severity and graph citations.

---

## 6. Connect to Neo4j Aura (production)

1. **Configure** — copy the env template and fill in credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://xxxx.databases.neo4j.io
   # NEO4J_USER / NEO4J_PASSWORD
   ```

2. **Seed directly via Bolt** (fastest):

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

   With Neo4j configured, committing an assessment in the UI persists it to the graph (`(:PullRequest)-[:ASSESSED_AS]->(:RiskAssessment)-[:JUSTIFIED_BY]->(:Evidence)-[:CITES]->(...)`).

3. **Or bulk-import via CSV (`LOAD CSV`)**:

   ```bash
   npm run dataset            # -> data/processed/codereview/*.csv
   ```

   Upload the CSVs to a public raw URL, then in Aura Query set the base URL and run the import script:

   ```cypher
   :param baseUrl => "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/data/processed/codereview/";
   ```

   Run [`domains/codereview/import.cypher`](../domains/codereview/import.cypher).

4. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   npm run aura:verify
   npm run aura:vectors    # optional: vector indexes for similarity search
   ```

---

## 7. Deploy the Aura agent (as code)

The agent is defined in [`domains/codereview/agent.json`](../domains/codereview/agent.json) — system prompt plus tools: `explain_pr_risk`, `recommend_reviewers`, `risk_propagation`, `architecture_compliance`, `related_incidents`, `tightly_coupled_modules`, Text2Cypher, and similarity search. Push it to your tenant via the Aura **v2beta1 `/agents`** API, or recreate the tools in the Aura Console. For a Free-tier MVP, the Text2Cypher-only path is documented in [docs/aura-console-agent-setup.md](aura-console-agent-setup.md).

---

## 8. Graph Evidence (UI)

The **Graph Evidence** panel below the assessment tabs shows the explainable subgraph for the selected PR:

- **Columns** — Change → Files → Modules → Services → Policies → Incidents → Lessons.
- **Red highlights** — risk paths (violations, forbidden deps, linked incidents).
- **Zoom & pan** — scroll to zoom, drag empty canvas to pan, toolbar +/- and fit, double-click to reset.
- **Metrics bar** — blast radius, security files, policy violations, evidence count.

---

## 9. Generate the presentation decks

```bash
npm run decks
# If PowerPoint has decks/dist open: DECKS_OUT=decks/dist-latest npm run decks
```

Produces four `.pptx` files in `decks/dist/`:

| File | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `01-business-overview.pptx` | Problem, idea, features, business value |
| `02-technical-overview.pptx` | Layers, schema, workflows, Aura, configuration |
| `03-getting-started.pptx` | Install, deploy, docs map, roadmap |
| `04-how-pr-analysis-works.pptx` | End-to-end PR analysis + 10‑minute demo script |

Slides are generated from the **live** code-review pack (`decks/build.js`), so they stay aligned with the code.

### Live GitHub demo (optional)

With `GITHUB_REPO` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env`, use **PR-9** (or your highest-risk open PR) for a realistic demo: subtle PR title, **Critical** score, and rich graph evidence when `docs/reviewgraph-config.json` is on the branch.

---

## 10. Where things live

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `server/index.js` | REST API (meta, entities, ask, assess, memory) |
| `server/memoryStore.js` | Agent memory (Neo4j or in-memory) |
| `domains/codereview/model.js` | Code Intelligence Graph + feature selectors |
| `domains/codereview/assess.js` | Explainable risk engine |
| `domains/codereview/questions.js` | Text2Cypher routing |
| `domains/codereview/agent.json` | The Aura agent defined as code |
| `decks/build.js` | `.pptx` generator |
| `docs/product-context.md` | Product vision + 3-layer graph model |

---

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 — Foundation:** PRs, Files, Modules, Dependencies, Text2Cypher *(done)*
- **Phase 2 — Knowledge:** reviewer knowledge, ADRs, incidents *(done)*
- **Phase 3 — Memory:** agent memory, historical reasoning, learning from reviews *(in progress)*
- **Phase 4 — Autonomy:** autonomous review recommendations, risk scoring, architecture governance

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Port 4000 in use** — stop the other process or set `PORT` in `.env`.
- **UI says API unavailable** — run `npm run dev` (both API and Vite). Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173` (not only `:4000`). Click **Refresh** after the server finishes GitHub ingest (~15s).
- **PR risk score too low on live repo** — ensure `docs/reviewgraph-config.json` exists on the PR branch; click **Refresh** so the server reloads full config (not truncated patch).
- **UI shows "Neo4j fallback"** — expected without `NEO4J_*`; in-memory graph still works. Set Aura credentials and `npm run seed` for live Neo4j.
- **React duplicate key warnings in console** — fixed in latest build (deduplicated graph edges); hard-refresh the browser.
